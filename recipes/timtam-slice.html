        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a simple to make, no-bake, tasty slice that uses Tim-Tam biscuits. It takes 30mins to make and makes about 20 pieces</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g plain biscuits</li>
            <li>2 x 200g packs of Tim-Tam biscuits</li>
            <li>200g butter</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cocoa</li>
            <li>4 tbsp dessicated coconut</li>
            <li>1 x 395g tin of condensed milk</li>
            <li>200g milk chocolate</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a 20cm x 20cm square cake tin with baking paper. Make sure you leave plenty of baking paper overhanging the edges of the pan to help you remove the slice once it has set.</li>
            <li>Roughly chop SIX of the Tim-Tams into large pieces and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the plain biscuits into a food processor and blitz until they have just broken up, then add the remaining whole Tim-Tams and blitz for 5 seconds or until they have broken into large chunks.</li>
            <li>Place the crushed biscuits into a large bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour the condensed milk into a small saucepan and add the butter and cocoa. Cook over a low heat stirring occasionally until the butter has melted and combined with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pour the melted ingredientsinto the bowl with the crushed biscuits and add the coconut.  Working quickly, use a metal spoon to mix the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into your prepared tin and flatten the surface with the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Break the milk chocolate into squares and place it into a microwave safe bowl. Cook in microwave on high for 30 second spurts, mixing in between, until the chocolate is just melted. Pour over the top of the slice and sprinkle the Tim-Tams you set aside earlier over the top.</li>
            <li>Place the slice in the fridge for 6 hours or overnight to set before cutting into squares.</li>
        </ol>
