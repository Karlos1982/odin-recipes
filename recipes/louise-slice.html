        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Base</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>75g Butter (softened)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup White Sugar</li>
            <li>2 Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups Plain Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup Raspberry, Plum or Blackcurrant Jam</li>
            <li>2 Egg Whites</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Dessicated Coconut</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C. Lightly grease a 20cm x 30cm shallow tin and line with baking paper.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then add egg yolks and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice, then sift the flour and baking powder and mix to form a firm dough.</li>
            <li>Press the dough evenly into the prepared tin and spread over the jam. <em>You don't need a thick layer.</em></li>
            <li>Beat the egg whites until stiff then gently fold in the caster sugar and the coconut using a metal spoon.</li>
            <li>Spread the egg white mixture carefully over the jam, trying to keep an even thickness. Sprinkle with a little more coconut.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 25 minutes until the coconut is just turning golden brown.</li>
            <li>Cut into squares or fingers while it is still warm. Cool in the tin on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
